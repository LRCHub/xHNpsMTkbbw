Black teeth, pale face
Ancien method is still in place
Never questioned in any place
Intact in memory trace
Sign of beauty travelling through the ages
An illusion is created, a wild smile is presented
Iron fillings soaked in tea, oxidation is complete
Black teeth, pale face
The taste of dye is harsh
The process is now repeated
Sign of strength underneath
Ohaguro, all attention is on you
Ohaguro, true beauty will cut through
Black teeth, pale face, shining
A rise to the elite
Process is now complete
A taste of bittersweet
I can't feel your heartbeat
